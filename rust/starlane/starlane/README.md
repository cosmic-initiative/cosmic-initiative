STARLANE

*A Mesh for extending any enterprise resource with WebAssembly*

This incarnation of Starlane is still being worked on as the packages in [The Cosmic Initiative](http://thecosmicinitiative.io)
of which Starlane is a composition are being heavily revised.

Right now there is not much to see here, however, there is an older version of Starlane (version 0.2.0) that
can be downloaded installed and toyed with which does at least on the outside behave very similar to how v0.3.0
will work.  You can find out more on [starlane.io](http://starlane.ioc).
