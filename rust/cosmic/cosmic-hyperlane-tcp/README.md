# COSMIC HYPERLANE
`cosmic-hyperlane` is part of [THE COSMIC INITIATIVE](http://thecosmicinitiative.io) a WebAssembly orchestration framework.

The Cosmic Hyperlane provides "Lanes" to queue Waves(messages) and Hyperways for back and forth Wave communication.
It provides services such as routing and authentication as well.

`cosmic-hyperlane` works entirely inside an application, but there are packages to extend its reach such as 
[cosmic-hyperlane-tcp](../cosmic-hyperlane-tcp/README.md) which adds TCP server and client.

## WORK IN PROGRESS
*this framework is a work in progress and not ready for production. And it is not yet fully documented for feedback and discussion .*

## BUILDS ON THE COSMIC UNIVERSE
The concepts in the `cosmic-hyperlane` package build upon the concepts in the [cosmic-universe](../cosmic-universe/README.md) 
package so familiarity with The Cosmic Universe is recommended before grappling with Hyperlane.
