# STARLANE


*A WEBASSEMBLY ORCHESTRATION FRAMEWORK*

Starlane is a framework for orchestrating WebAssembly components locally
and/or accross every tier of the enterprise (Browser,Mobile,Desktop,Server,Edge,IoT.)

It's charter is to help developers increase focus on their software products **Unique Value Offering** by automagically providing as much **Infrastructure** as possible.

## MEDIUM ARTICLE
I wrote a nifty [medium article](https://medium.com/@uberscott/starlane-reduce-the-drudgery-of-infrastructure-code-with-webassembly-398d1b0d19f1) that explains Starlane's basic rationale.  I hope you read it!


## WORK IN PROGRESS
*this framework is a work in progress and not ready for production. It is ready for feedback and discussion.*

## WHAT TO SEE
To get started take a look at the [cosmic-space](rust/cosmic/cosmic-space) package.

After that you might find the [cosmic-hyperspace](rust/cosmic/cosmic-hyperspace) interesting.


## STARLANE - THE STATE OF THINGS
Development has been halted over the last 2 years, but I'm picking it up again in my free time.  I would love to have some contributors help shape this thing!
Please reach out to me if you want: scott@uberscott.com

There is a working previous version 0.2.0 which can be downloaded and experimented with, however,
the archetecture for the upcoming 0.3.0 is already quite different and 0.3.0 is not in a ready
state to download and toy with.
