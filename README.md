# THE COSMIC INITIATIVE

*A WEBASSEMBLY ORCHESTRATION FRAMWORK*

The Cosmic Initiative is a framework for orchestrating WebAssembly components locally
and/or accross every tier of the enterprise (Browser,Mobile,Desktop,Server,Edge,IoT.)

For a quick overview visit [The Cosmic Initiative](http://thecosmicinitiative.io) website.


## WORK IN PROGRESS
*this framework is a work in progress and not ready for production. It is ready for feedback and discussion.*

## WHAT TO SEE
To get started take a look at the [cosmic-space](rust/cosmic/cosmic-space) package.

After that you might find the [cosmic-hyperspace](rust/cosmic/cosmic-hyperspace) interesting.


## STARLANE - A REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION
The Cosmic Initiative has one reference implementation at this time called [Starlane](http://starlane.io)  

There is a working previous version 0.2.0 which can be downloaded and experimented with, however,
the archetecture for the upcoming 0.3.0 is already quite different and 0.3.0 is not in a ready
state to download and toy with.
